## Rakan's Feather

This is a game I first started creating in grade 10 for my final assignment in Gr.11 CS class. It is somewhat of a tribute to Arcane with some character and object resemblences. BUT, you will also see that there are elements of League - hence the name, Rakan's Feather. I am a huge League enjoyer so if you would like to join me in League sometimes, add BarSoapIllumi! 

All of the game elements were created by either me or a friend (Yuki), so no copyright there! I even played the background music LOL

Yes, the game is in a JAR file in the repo so you can play it if you download it. No, I swear I did not put a virus in there, but take caution I guess.

## Controls

- "up", "down", "left", "right" keys are used for movement
- "shift" to run
- "z" to select/talk to character(s)
- "esc" to pause

** as a side note, you must be stepping on the objects to collect them with "z" **

## Main Objective

The current version of this game is very much like a treasure hunting game, where you must find the NPC desires. I can't say much more, find out for yourself!

hint: talk to the NPC first to know what the objective is?

## Future Updates

There are some bugs I would like to address in future updates, such as the collision not working properly for the NPC. I would also like to expand the current map, by around 20 tiles (at least), and add the new maps. 

If you have noticed, there are little houses in the North of the map. And if you tried to interact with them, you may have realized 1. the collision for the door isn't working? and 2. literally nothing happens. I will make the inside of the hut a thing in the future I swear!

## Credits

Credits are in the game! Or if you don't have it, just go into the UI class in main package and you'll eventually find the credits if you read closely. 

However, I would like to give a shoutout here for my friend Yuki, who is the main character of the game, and dressed up in a clown costume! Also huge shoutout to RyiSnow, since I followed his tutorial that was IMMENSELY helpful for a beginner like me! This game would not have been possible without the 2 of them. I could also never forget all of my other friends who supported my small game updates on Instagram and gave me a lot of motivation to keep going. 

Love y'alls <3
